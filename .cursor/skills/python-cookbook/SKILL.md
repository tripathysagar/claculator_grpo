  Practical, example-driven recipes for the Python standard library and everyday
  idioms - string/text wrangling, formatting, regex, numbers, the core data
  structures (list/tuple/set/dict) and comprehensions/itertools, functions,
  classes, dates/times, modules/imports, files/paths/IO, env vars and argparse,
  subprocess, serialization (JSON/CSV/pickle/XML/gzip), concurrency, networking,
  logging, debugging, introspection, CPU/memory profiling, exceptions, testing
  with pytest/unittest, virtualenvs, packaging, and code quality. Use when the
  user asks "how do I do X in Python?", needs a stdlib snippet or idiom, is
  formatting strings/numbers, writing a regex, transforming a dict/list, handling
  paths/files, parsing CLI args, running a subprocess, reading/writing
  JSON/CSV, adding logging, profiling slow code, tracking memory, writing tests,
  pinning dependencies, or packaging a project. Distilled from "Stas' Python
  Cookbook" open book, the latest version of which can be found at

# Stas' Python Cookbook

> Distilled from **Stas' Python Cookbook** open book by Stas Bekman - source: https://github.com/stas00/python-cookbook (CC BY-SA 4.0). This skill is a condensed index; each section links back to the full chapter for depth, runnable snippets, and gotchas.

A practical, standard-library-first reference for the Python idioms that come up again and again in real work. It leads with the *why*, shows the *how* with copy-paste snippets, and calls out the gotchas that bite in practice. Targets **Python 3.8+**; version-specific features are flagged inline. For deep single-process/tool debugging (gdb, strace, py-spy, core files, CUDA) pair this with [The Art of Debugging](https://github.com/stas00/the-art-of-debugging/blob/master/SKILL.md).

For offline details, read the relevant section of [reference.md](reference.md) before using the remote chapter links below.

## Core principles

- **Reach for the standard library first.** A third-party package is only suggested when the stdlib genuinely falls short - and it's flagged with `pip install`.
- **Prefer the modern idiom.** f-strings over `%`/`.format()`, `pathlib` over `os.path`, `subprocess.run` over `os.system`, dataclasses over ad-hoc tuples, `logging` over `print` in real programs.
- **Know the gotcha before it bites.** Mutable default arguments, shallow vs deep copy, pass-by-object-reference, naive vs aware datetimes, the GIL - each chapter flags the trap.
- **Read the linked section before applying a recipe** - each has worked examples, caveats, and edge cases the one-liner here omits.

## Notes for AI agents

- **Prefer the stdlib and the modern idiom** (f-strings, `pathlib`, `subprocess.run`, dataclasses, `logging`) unless the user's environment dictates otherwise; only add a dependency when the stdlib truly can't do it.
- **Watch the flagged gotchas** - mutable default args, shallow vs deep copy, pass-by-object-reference, naive datetimes, `shell=True`, bare `except`, string version comparison - before shipping a snippet.
- **Measure before optimizing:** profile with `cProfile`/`timeit`/`tracemalloc` rather than guessing which line is slow or leaky.
- **Read the linked chapter section** before applying an unfamiliar recipe - each has worked examples, caveats, and copy-paste code the index line omits.
- **Note the target version** (3.8+ baseline); guard newer-only features (`|` dict merge, `str.removeprefix`, `zoneinfo`, structural pattern matching) when portability matters.
- For deep runtime debugging of a crash/hang/segfault/OOM (gdb, strace, py-spy, core files, CUDA), use the companion skill: [The Art of Debugging](https://github.com/stas00/the-art-of-debugging/blob/master/SKILL.md).
